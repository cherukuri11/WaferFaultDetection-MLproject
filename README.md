# WaferFaultDetection-MLproject

Problem Statement
To build a classification methodology to predict the quality of wafer sensors based on the given training data. 
Architecture

Data Description
The client will send data in multiple sets of files in batches at a given location. Data will contain Wafer names and 590 columns of different sensor values for each wafer.
The last column will have the "Good/Bad" value for each wafer.
"Good/Bad" column will have two unique values +1 and -1.  
"+1" represents Bad wafer.
"-1" represents Good Wafer.
